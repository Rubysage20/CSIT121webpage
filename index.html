Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour, vanilla, and salt and beat until combined. <br> 
		<br> Step 4. <br><br> 
		Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly in the center , about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to cool completely and firm up before assembling. <br>
